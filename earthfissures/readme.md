# Earth Fissures
Earth fissures are open surface fractures that may be as much as a mile in length, up to 15 ft wide, and 10s of feet deep.

Earth fissures are open surface fractures that may be as much as a mile in length, up to 15 ft wide, and 10s of feet deep. In Arizona, earth fissures form as a result of land subsidence driven by groundwater withdrawal. The Arizona Geological Survey has mapped and reported earth fissures throughout south-central and southeastern Arizona since the 1990s and published earth fissure study area maps in accordance with Arizona Revised Statute § 27-152.01(3) since 2007. Mapping of fissures involves incorporating mapped earth fissures from previous studies, examining remotely sensed subsidence data and aerial imagery, and on-site field mapping using high-precision GPS receivers.

Between 2007 and 2012, AZGS identified 24 discreet areas throughout southern and central Arizona with concentrations of earth fissures totaling more than 150 miles of mapped fissures. These include uninterrupted open fissures and fissure gullies and discontinuous linear trends of potholes, abbreviated open cracks, elongated depressions, and other collapse features. An additional 180 miles of reported/unconfirmed earth fissures appear on AZGS maps. These features include fissures previously mapped by professional geologists appearing in published maps or figures which could not be confirmed through recent surface mapping by AZGS Geologists.

A reasonable effort was made to identify all earth fissures in the study area although some fissures may remain unmapped due to overprinting or disturbance by development, agricultural tilling, or lack of surface expression along the fissure at the time mapping was conducted. In addition, earth fissures are not static features. They may change in width, depth or length, and new fissures may appear after an area has been mapped. For these reasons the State of Arizona does not guarantee the maps are error free. Blank areas within study area boundaries have been investigated and no surface evidence of fissures was found as of the date of map publication.
